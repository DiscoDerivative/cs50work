The main function initializes the temps array,
 calls the sort_cities function and prints out
  the array in sorted order. You will use an O(n2)
   sorting algorithm of your choice (possibly bubble sort,
    selection sort, or insertion sort) to sort the array by
     temperature, in descending order.
