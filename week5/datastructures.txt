data structures are forms of organizing memory
abstract data structures: conceptually imagine

queues are a form of abstract data structures
they follow a first in first out principle
example: waiting in a line at an amusement park.
first person gets to go on the ride first.
last person gets to go on the ride last.

queues have specific actions associated with them.
an item can be enqueued and dequeued when it reaches the front of the line.

queues contrast a stack.
a stack follows the last in first out principle
example: stacking trays in a cafetieria.
a tray that is placed in stack last is the first one that gets picked up.

stacks have specific actions associated with them.
push places something on top of a stack and pop removes something from the top of the stack
